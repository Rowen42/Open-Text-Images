Either opens or generates images using text from a csv file. If the name of an image file is in the images folder, the image will be opened full screen. If the name has not been found then it will generate an image of the text from randomly generated fonts and colours which is then opened. The second column in the csv file is Time where the number 0 means that to move on to the next image you press the space bar. If the number is greater than 0, that is the time in seconds until the next image will be opened.
